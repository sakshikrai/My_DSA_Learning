# My_DSA_Learning

A focused, daily log of LeetCode problems solved in **C++ and Python**.

This repository is my personal practice space for Data Structures & Algorithms where I upload one or more LeetCode solutions each day implemented in modern C++ and Python. Every file follows a small, consistent template so solutions are easy to read, compile, and run.

## What this repo is

Daily LeetCode and DSA practice in **C++ & Python** — a centralized place to store, organize, and improve solutions to problems.

The primary goals are to:

- Practice algorithmic problem solving every day.
- Strengthen core DSA concepts (Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Trees, Graphs, etc.).
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts where relevant.
- Keep solutions readable, annotated, and reproducible.
- Track progress and maintain a consistent format.

## Language & toolchain

### Primary Languages
- **C++ (C++17 standard)**
- **Python**

### Coding Style
- Clear variable names
- Short helper functions
- Comments for algorithmic steps
- Time and Space complexity mentioned
- Minimal `main()` function or small test harness

## DSA Concept Practice

Apart from daily LeetCode challenges, I also solve structured DSA topic-wise problems such as:

- Arrays & Strings  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Searching & Sorting  
- Stack & Queue  
- Linked List  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  

This helps in strengthening fundamentals along with problem-solving speed.
