# My_DSA_Learning

A focused, daily log of LeetCode problems solved in C++.

This repository is my personal practice space for Data Structures & Algorithms where I upload one or more LeetCode solutions each day implemented in modern C++. Every file follows a small, consistent template so solutions are easy to read, compile and run.

## What this repo is
Daily LeetCode practice in C++: a centralized place to store, organize, and improve solutions to LeetCode problems. The primary goals are to:
- Practice algorithmic problem solving every day.
- Keep solutions readable, annotated, and reproducible.
- Track progress and maintain a consistent format.

## Language & toolchain
- Primary language: C++ (target standard: C++17)
  
Coding style:
- Prefer clear variable names and short helper functions.
- Add comments for algorithmic steps and complexity.
- Keep main() minimal where possible (or include a small test harness).


## Learning resources
- LeetCode (https://leetcode.com)
- "Introduction to Algorithms" (CLRS)
- GeeksforGeeks, CP-algorithms, and online tutorials for specific patterns
